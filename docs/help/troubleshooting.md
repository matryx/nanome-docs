#### Tips to use your Oculus Quest in a VPN network


##### New Method
The Oculus Quest 2 with the v29 firmware update from Oculus enables the use of arbitrary APK files (Android apps) to be used on the device. This means that you can sideload / install the APK file of your favorite VPN to the device, log in, and use as if you would for an Android device. Note that your VPN provider must offer an APK for this to work. We have seen it work properly with NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Cisco AnyConnect, and several others.

##### Old method

Method 1: VPN-enabled Hotspot from a Windows 10 PC
Requirements: 
1. An existing organizational VPN and VPN software on your PC
2. Admin access to your Windows 10 PC
3. Have VPN Credentials on hand
4. Validate your Wireless card can support this! https://www.quora.com/How-do-i-know-if-i-have-Qualcomm-Atheros-wireless-card

Once all requirements are met, follow these steps to create a VPN-enabled hotspot:

Step 1: Open your VPN Software, Enter your credentials, and connect to your VPN

Verify you have an internet connection through the VPN and check your IP address to validate it changed and note the location/IP for later (https://whatismyipaddress.com/)

Step 2: Hit Windows Key + type Mobile Hotspot

Open Mobile Hotspot and change your wifi name and password then turn on the hotspot

Step 3: Open your Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings. 

Step 4. Identify which connection is your Ethernet # with the indicator "Unidentified Network, TAP-&lt;VPNType&gt; Windows Adapter 

Step 5: Right click it and go to the Sharing tab

Step 6: Check allow sharing for other users in the network. From the dropdown, select your mobile hotspot connection "Local Area Connection #". It should be labeled as Wifi Direct Virtual Adapter

Step 7: Join the Mobile Hotspot Wifi from your Oculus Quest

Step 8: Verify you have the VPN applied by checking your IP/location (https://whatismyipaddress.com/)

Step 9: Launch and enjoy Nanome behind your firewall!
