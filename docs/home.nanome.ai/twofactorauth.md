# Enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

You can enable 2FA on your Nanome for added security. After connecting an authentication app, you will be required to enter a 6-digit code every time you log into your Nanome account.

You'll be prompted to scan the QR code with your app, and then enter a 6-digit code to confirm. Make sure to download the recovery codes as well!

### Step 4: You're all set! Now you'll be prompted to enter your 2FA code every time you log into your Nanome account.

Note: while it is strongly encouraged to enable 2FA on your account, if you wish to disable 2FA you can navigate to Account Setting and click "Disable 2FA" under the Security section.
