# Wrist Menu

<vimg src="nanome-v2/wristmenu.png" />

This is a personalized menu that is attached to your virtual "wrist". There is a large button displaying the time - clicking this button will show/hide the Application Menu.

A simplified top bar shows which workspace the user is in, who is in that session, and offers spotlight/follow controls similar to the Application Menu.
