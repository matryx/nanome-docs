## How to enable/disable auto height adjustment

<vimg src="howto-page/autoheightsetting.jpg" />

 Auto height calibration can be toggled on/off using the action menu. If users are having height issues, we recommend using this toggle to help troubleshoot the issue. By default, the toggle is off when users are in Mixed Reality Passthrough and turned on when users are in virtual reality. If height issues persist, we recommend resetting your floor height by calibrating your device. EX: with meta devices, this is done by resetting the guardian.

## How to export a molecule for future access or other softwares

1. Select the structure you want to save.
2. On the Entry List menu, click the [Export button](https://docs.nanome.ai/navigation/menus.html#export)
3. On the menu that appears after clicking Export, select where on your computer you want to save the structure (Desktop or Documents), and then select the file format you want to export to (pdb, sdf, or mmcif).

## How to load a structure stored on local computer

1. Go to the [Load menu](https://docs.nanome.ai/navigation/menus.html#load).
2. Click on [Files](https://docs.nanome.ai/navigation/menus.html#my-files) and then select the location (Desktop or Documents) where you saved the structure.
3. You should then see the filename for the structure you saved. Click on the file, then click "load files".

## How to load a MD trajectory file

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125503369/235212408-5e740ee3-1cb3-49a3-9bd9-0cc5aba5137a.mp4

Nanome supports the following MD trajectory files: .PDB, .PSE, .DCD, .GRO, .XTC, .TRR. 
1. Go to the [Load menu](https://docs.nanome.ai/navigation/menus.html#load).
2. Click on [Files](https://docs.nanome.ai/navigation/menus.html#my-files). Navigate to the folder that contains your trajectories and press load (you may also have to multi-select the topology file for trajectories generated via Gromacs or Desmond.
If a trajectory doesn’t load properly, please try reducing its frame count and/or export as a multi-model .PDB. Additionally, please let us know some details about the problematic files and we can look into resolving them. Relevant details would include the file format type and the number of frames. Typically, the shorter the trajectory the easier time you’ll have to load it in. 
3. Once loaded, you can play the trajectory by launching the “Frame” menu represented by this icon on the [Entry List](https://docs.nanome.ai/navigation/menus.html#entry-list):

## How to open the Frame Menu and execute frame operations

Find the entity containing multiple frames that you have loaded on the [Entry Menu](https://docs.nanome.ai/navigation/menus.html#main-menus). Click on the second button from the right on the same row. This is the [Frame Menu](https://docs.nanome.ai/navigation/menus.html#frame-data) Button.

### How to change frame

Click on the arrow buttons on the left side of the [Frame Menu](https://docs.nanome.ai/navigation/menus.html#frame-data) to change frame.

### How to duplicate a frame 

Click on the Duplicate Frame button on the right side of the [Frame Menu](https://docs.nanome.ai/navigation/menus.html#frame-data) to change frame.

### How to swap molecules from the list of frames

1. Click on the Frames Tab Button on the top left to switch to the Frames Tab.
2. Click on one of the models in the list to switch to that molecule.

### How to show meta data on frame

Click on the Meta Data Tab Button on the top right to switch to Meta Data Tab.

## How to view Windows content in Nanome

<vimg src="howto-page/WindowsContent.gif" />

When using the Oculus Rift/Rift S or Oculus Link (Quest connected to a desktop), users can take advantage of Oculus Dash to ‘pin’ windows or their entire desktop in VR and Nanome. This means users can view excel sheets, websites, and other 3rd party software while the headset is on. This way, users can seamlessly work in Nanome with their existing desktop apps. However, please note that this pinned window is not visible to other users in the same room. If you want to collaboratively view a PDF file with your colleague in Nanome, please [load](https://docs.nanome.ai/navigation/menus.html#load) the PDF file into your workspace.

To view the documentation on how to use Oculus Dash, please visit the official oculus support page: [https://support.oculus.com/166993604065478/](https://support.oculus.com/166993604065478/)

## How to find the log file of a previous session

<vimg src="howto-page/LogFile.png" />

If your session crashes or you encounter any issues in Nanome, you can go to "C:\Users\\[USERNAME]\AppData\LocalLow\Nanome Inc_\Nanome\History" to retrieve the log file and send it to us at support@nanome.ai so that we can help you troubleshoot the problem.

If you are using the Oculus Quest or Oculus Quest 2 VR headsets, then you can plug your device into a computer and go to "Quest\Internal shared storage\Android\data\com.Nanome.NanomeCurie\files\History" to access the log file.

A log file's name follows the format of "YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_details.txt" and is determined by the starting time of the session.

## How to access Nanome on the Oculus Quest family of headsets

Nanome can be loaded onto the Oculus Quest or Oculus Quest 2 via a few different methods. In 2021, Nanome was added to the Oculus App Lab (see [here](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3077598929010226/)), which means Nanome can now be found in the Quest store. When searching for Nanome, the result will initially be hidden - you need to open the "App Lab" results to find the Nanome application. See the animation below for more details. (Note: this process was performed on a smartphone.)

<vimg src="howto-page/nanome_on_oculus_quest.gif"/>

Downloading Nanome from Oculus App Lab will be the easiest method for getting access to the software on your Quest device. For alternative methods (such as sideloading), you can refer to our [setup page](https://nanome.ai/setup).

## How to access pre-release beta versions of Nanome

Prior to the official release of each new Nanome version, we will make available a beta release on the Steam and Oculus stores. These are strictly beta builds and are not meant for regular use; rather, you have an opportunity to preview the next version as we are putting the finishing touches on it.

On the Steam store, you can switch to the beta release by following [this guide](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/branches). On the Oculus store, refer to the following GIF. (Be sure to switch back to the ‘LIVE’ for the latest stable release.)

<vimg src="howto-page/beta-release-oculus-store.gif" />

If you are participating in our Oculus Quest Nanome beta, please request the pre-release beta of the next version by emailing [support@nanome.ai](mailto:support@nanome.ai).

**REMINDER:** During collaborative sessions with other users, those on different versions will NOT be able to see each other’s lobbies or will have features that may not fully function. For collaborative sessions with other users, please ensure you are on the same version of Nanome.

If you'd like to leave us any feedback on the beta releases, you can fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/DsTkDCuqAzhP4vJR8).
