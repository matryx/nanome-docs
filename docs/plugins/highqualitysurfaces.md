# High Quality Surfaces

# Description

The High Quality Surfaces plugin is a tool for creating and modifying surfaces. The plugin provides various tools for editing and modifying surfaces, including adding or removing vertices, faces, and edges, applying textures, and creating and modifying curves and meshes. 

A Nanome Plugin to run [MSMS](https://www.scripps.edu/sanner/html/msms_home.html) that computes molecular surfaces and load them in Nanome.

This plugin also computes Ambient Occlusion (AO) to darken buried parts of the molecular surfaces using https://github.com/nezix/AOEmbree
