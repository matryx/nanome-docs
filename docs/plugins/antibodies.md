# Antibodies Representation

The Antibody Representation plugin adds the IMGT color scheme, labels antibody regions on a selected protein, and highlights CDR loops.  A table of Antibody Regions allows independent selection of CDR loops for calculations or representational changes.  Importantly, only antibodies and fragments of antibodies are modified; the representation of antigens in the complex is unchanged.

<td width="50%" >The plugin is accessible through the stacks menu. Select the antibody structure in the Entry list, click Activate and then Run.   The structure will update with heavy and light chains colored in grays and CDR loops colored according to the IMGT scheme.</td>

Select CDR loops from the table by clicking on the labeled buttons.  The 3D structure will show selection highlights on the loops.

## Application of CDR Selections
Selection of CDR loops from the Regions table can be used in conjunction with other Nanome menus and plugins. Some examples of plugins are **Chemical Interactions** and **High Quality Surfaces**.

### Calculate **Chemical Interactions** between the residues of selected CDR loops with proteins within 5 angstroms in 4 steps.  
<vimg src="plugins-page/antibodies/image8.png" />

1.  Make selections in the Regions table
2.  Activate and Run the Chemical Interactions plugin from the stacks menu to launch the plugin menu
3.  In the menu, confirm the selection of your protein, the selection of “Selected Atoms/Residues”, and make any adjustment to what interactions to show.
4.  Click “Calculate”

*Chemical Interactions made by the residues of 2 CDR loops*

### Generate High Quality Surfaces on any selection of CDR loops  in 5 steps.

1.  Make selections in the Regions table
2.  Activate the High Quality Surfaces plugin from the stacks menu to launch the plugin menu
3.  In the menu, select the protein, and a chain that contains the selection or the entire protein.
4.  In the right panel of the menu, set the “selection only” toggle to “on”.  This will apply surfaces to the selected CDR loops in the Regions table, as well as any other selections made on the structure using the select tool, entry list, or other menus.  
5.  Click “Generate” and modify surface colors and opacity to purpose.
