# Nanome 1.x (1st Gen) Overview

Nanome 1.x is the first generation of Nanome, a real-time collaborative molecular modeling platform for molecular biology and chemistry. It uses off the shelf Mixed Reality headsets such as the Meta Quest 3 and the Apple Vision Pro enabling scientists around the world to collaborate and manipulate molecular structures. With primary uses in the pharmaceutical industry, specifically in Structure-Based Drug Design, Nanome is used by many drug hunters such as medicinal chemists, computational chemists, structural biologists, and protein engineers to collaboratively design molecules.
