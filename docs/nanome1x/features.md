# Key Features

Nanome supports a wide range of features that enable scientific workflows.

Our feature list is the following:

- Import molecules from public databases such as the RCSB Protein Data Bank, Pubchem, Drugbank, or your own computer.
- Mutate through the most common amino acids and rotamer conformation or minimize your structure.
- Grab, rotate, or enlarge your molecules and measure distances or angles between atoms with your hands.
- Analyze your structures and binding sites or explore the fit of different ligands.
- Share a virtual lab in real time with colleagues across the globe. Or join VR sessions via a 2D interface.
- Customize your virtual workspace and save you VR sessions for future presenting or collaboration.

## Collaboration

Both VR users and 2D users can collaborate in a virtual space.
