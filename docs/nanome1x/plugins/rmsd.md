# RMSD

The RMSD plugin allows users to select multiple molecules, run an root-mean-squared deviation calculation, and auto-align the structures.

To use this plugin, select your input structures to align, the target structure to align to and hit Run. If you intend to align entire structures, make sure that the Selected Only button is toggled off.
