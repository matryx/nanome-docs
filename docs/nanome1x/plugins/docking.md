# Docking

The docking plugin interfaces with a variety of docking software to dock ligands to a receptor and display the result in Nanome. Currently supported docking software includes:

- Smina
- Autodock 4


## Instructions

To use the plugin, select a receptor to bind to.

Then, select one or more ligands to bind.

Finally, select the site at which to dock the ligands. For most cases, the ligand is used as the site, and it is placed in the approximate pocket of the receptor.

You will receive notifications when docking has finished.
