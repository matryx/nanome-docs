Nanome supports a wide range of features that enable scientific workflows.

Our feature list is the following: 

Import molecules from public databases such as the RCSB Protein Data Bank, Pubchem, Drugbank, or your own computer.

Mutate through the most common amino acids and rotamer conformation or minimize your structure.

Grab, rotate, or enlarge your molecules and measure distances or angles between atoms with your hands.

Analyze your structures and binding sites or explore the fit of different ligands.

Share a virtual lab in real time with colleagues across the globe. Or join VR sessions via a 2D interface.

Customize your virtual workspace and save you VR sessions for future presenting or collaboration.
